# portfolio

This project is used in conjunction with Github Pages and represents a selection of my portfolio. Since i am a Software Developer, this project itself can be seen as a credential.

**Note:** I am in a bit of a time pressure - so the code of this project won't be cleaned up until more important things got resolved.
